## What Is MitoThrive?

MitoThrive is a dietary supplement designed to combat age-related cellular decline by replenishing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and supporting mitochondrial health. NAD+ is a crucial coenzyme involved in cellular energy production, DNA repair, and metabolic processes. As we age, NAD+ levels naturally decline, leading to decreased energy and increased susceptibility to age-related health issues. MitoThrive's formulation targets this decline, aiming to restore vitality and promote healthy aging. 

## Key Ingredients

MitoThrive's efficacy is attributed to its blend of scientifically backed ingredients:

- **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)**: A precursor to NAD+, NR has been shown to effectively raise NAD+ levels, enhancing mitochondrial function and energy production. 

- **Apigenin**: A natural flavonoid found in various plants, apigenin exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It also inhibits CD38, an enzyme that degrades NAD+, thereby helping to maintain higher NAD+ levels. 

- **L-Glutathione**: A potent antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and supports detoxification processes, contributing to overall cellular health. 

- **Longevity & Vitality Kickstart Blend**: This proprietary blend includes:

  - *N-Acetyl L-Cysteine*: A precursor to glutathione, supporting antioxidant defenses.

  - *Beta Glucan*: Known for its immune-boosting properties.

  - *Berberine HCL*: Supports metabolic health and blood sugar regulation.

  - *Broccoli Extract (BroccoliPE)*: Rich in sulforaphane, promoting detoxification and antioxidant activity.

  - *Hyaluronic Acid*: Supports skin hydration and joint health.

These ingredients work synergistically to enhance mitochondrial function, boost NAD+ levels, and promote overall vitality. 

## How Does MitoThrive Work?

MitoThrive operates by:

1. **Replenishing NAD+ Levels**: Nicotinamide Riboside serves as a direct precursor to NAD+, effectively increasing its availability in the body. 

2. **Inhibiting NAD+ Degradation**: Apigenin inhibits the activity of CD38, an enzyme responsible for breaking down NAD+, thereby preserving NAD+ levels. 

3. **Enhancing Mitochondrial Function**: By boosting NAD+ levels, MitoThrive supports mitochondrial efficiency, leading to improved energy production and cellular health. 

4. **Providing Antioxidant Support**: Ingredients like L-Glutathione and components of the proprietary blend offer antioxidant protection, reducing oxidative stress and supporting overall health.
